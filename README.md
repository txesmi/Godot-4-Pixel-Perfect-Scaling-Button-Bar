# Godot 4 Pixel Perfect Scaling Button Bar
This plugin lets you add a bar of scaling buttons to your project. 
The bitmaps define the size of normal and hovered sizes of the buttons. Bitmaps and sizes are mixed linerly when hovered or clicked.
The buttons are autom√°tically positioned in reference to the positioning of the bar.

Use with caution ;)
