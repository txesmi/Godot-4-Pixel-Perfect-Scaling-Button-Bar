# Godot 4 Pixel Perfect Scaling Button Bar
Minimum Godot version: 4.4.stable

This plugin lets you add a bar of scaling buttons to your project. 
The bitmaps define the size of normal and hovered sizes of the buttons. Bitmaps and sizes are mixed linearly when hovered or clicked.
The buttons contained in the bar are automaticaly positioned in reference to the positioning of the bar.
Buttons can be used independently.

Use with caution ;)
